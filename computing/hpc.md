# HPC Systems

## Illinois Campus Cluster

For the Illinois Campus Cluster, please request an account [here](https://campuscluster.illinois.edu/new_forms/user_form.php)
and enter Professor Novak as the advisor. This will give you access to a group directory in the `/projects` folder
where we share materials and code. Please use the `ENG-RESEARCH` partition when submitting jobs,
which is a free partition for all UIUC engineering students.

## Requesting Allocations

Most HPC systems require you to request an allocation for time (e.g. node-hours). Below are a list of some programs to consider.

- [ACCESS](https://allocations.access-ci.org/prepare-requests-overview) (includes NCSA Delta). Three tiers can be requested at any time for small to moderate requests, whereas the "maximize" tier follows similar process as large allocation programs.
- [INCITE](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/science/incite-allocation-program)
