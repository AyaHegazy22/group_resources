# HPC Access

Our group uses a variety of HPC systems.

## Illinois Campus Cluster

For the Illinois Campus Cluster, please request an account [here](https://campuscluster.illinois.edu/new_forms/user_form.php)
and enter Professor Novak as the advisor. This will give you access to a group directory in the `/projects` folder
where we share materials and code. Please use the `ENG-RESEARCH` partition when submitting jobs,
which is a free partition for all UIUC engineering students.
