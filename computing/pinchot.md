# Pinchot

Pinchot is a server owned by Prof. Novak which students are free to use for running simulations, building code, etc. To access, use
your NetID (replace for `ajnovak2`):

```
ssh ajnovak2@pinchot.npre.illinois.edu
```

If you are not on campus internet, you will need to be on the UIUC VPN. Instructions are
[here](https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois/page.php?id=47629). If you already have a VPN
client, simply enter `vpn.illinois.edu` and "Connect."
