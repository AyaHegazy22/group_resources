# General Thoughts for Making Good Presentations

A conference presentation is an excellent way to share our research with
the broader community. Effective communication is critical to keeping an
engaged audience who understands your message and is interested in learning
in more depth about our work.

## Slide Tips

Minimize the amount of text and detail on slides as much as possible.
When people watch a presentation, they will default to looking directly
at you, and generally only really pay attention to the slides as you direct
them to. But, if you have a very word-heavy slide, people tend to split half
their focus on listening to you, with the other half focusing on the slides
(to the overall detriment in their understanding).

- Minimize text on slides
- Use easy-to-follow slides that match the message you are conveying.
- It can be effective to put an overall motivation *before* the table of
  contents, to hook people's interest and give them a general context before
  showing them the outline.
- You can split up a complex diagram/image by selectively revealing parts of it
  at a time so that the audience's eyes are directed appropriately.
- Try using fading, where perhaps you fade part of a slide as you increment
  through a discussion.
- Include backup slides for any content which is not critical to your message,
  but which may be needed to address anticipated questions from the audience.
- Say thank you at the beginning and end of the presentation, for people's time,
  attention, and the opportunity to be there. If you are a student, also state
  which year in the program you are.
- If there is something on a slide you do not plan to talk about, omit it. Move
  it to a backup slide.
- Put your contact info and a funding acknowledgement on your last slide. If you
  are supported on a funded project or a fellowship, it is good to also state
  that. Do not give a sense of flippancy when addressing funding, it is crtical
  to our research.
- If you are borrowing an image from someone who is not a close collaborator, you
  should include the relevant citation on the slide.
- I typically put all other citations in a backup slide, if necessary.

## Body Language/Delivery

- Be respectful. When contrasting our work with the literature, you may want
  to frame that as "building upon" others foundations.
- You should always practice your presentation before other people see it
  (including in our group). Be sure that you are within the alloted time.
- Memorize your first 1-3 slides (but speak in a casual way that masks the
  fact that you memorized them). This can help you get over the initial nerves.
- Using cadence and emphasis while you speak can hold attention better than
  flat monotone voice. Hand motions can be useful if you have a multi-point
  sentence.
- Face the audience. Do not dominate eye contact with a single person.
- When transitioning between slides, if there is any introductory/prep that you
  need to explain before people are instantly distracted by a new slide of images,
  do so just before you transition the slide.
- Use analogies when possible, to help reinforce a point. For example, you can relate
  dimensions to common, everyday objects.
- Make it very clear what is novel/interesting/unique about your work. Tell people
  before you show them the results, and then remind them again after.
- Humor can be effective! You can try "show of hands"-type queries (this is most
  effective if you think a lot of people in the room will raise their hands, because
  some people will be shy and just not raise their hand even if it applies to them).
  Amusing graphics/ridiculous scales of problems (e.g. how many elements would you have
  in a full-core HTGR mesh if you explicitly meshed all TRISOs, and how that equates to
  # of Frontier computers, etc) can be useful.
- When it comes to Q&A, do not make anything up if you do not know. It is acceptable
  to say "we plan to explore that in future work," "I would like to follow up on
  that topic after this session," or "I will defer to my colleage, X, who led that
  part of this study."
