### Reactor Kinetics and Dynamics (NPRE 560)

This class presents historical approaches to fission reactor kinetics and dynamics, where the lectures and homeworks follow Introductory Nuclear Reactor Dynamics (Ott and Neuhold) and Dynamics of Nuclear Reactors (Hetrick) to the letter. Most of the methods discussed in the course have been antiquated by advances in computing over the last 30-40 years, however the intuition provided by these discussions may prove valuable to someone who is unfamiliar with the time behavior of fission reactors. The computer projects are the most useful components of the class to all students as they can be taylored to one's individual research interests. They consist of implementing various methods for point reactor kinetics (CP1), point reactor dynamics with feedback (CP2), and a kinetics/dynamics project of the student's choice (CP3).
